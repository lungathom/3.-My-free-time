My space

I think of myself as a person that is gifted with hands, i sometimes call myself a carpenter beacouse i enjoy making, and repair wooden objects and structures, from chest of drawers, side bed pedestals, you name it. I also enjoy action movies. and i like to research alot, lately i've found myself googling a bunch of stuff just to gain new knowledge. I quess thats the boring me.
